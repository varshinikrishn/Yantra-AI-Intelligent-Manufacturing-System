Yantra AI - An intelligence platform which interacts with manufacturing operations

This project is the implementation and dissertation work for my MSc in Data Analytics.  
Yantra AI is an intelligent Industry 4.0 platform designed for manufacturing operations, providing:

- Predictive maintenance using Random Forest Classifier  
- Real-time anomaly detection using Isolation Forest  
- Energy consumption forecasting using Random Forest Regressor  
- Interactive dashboards using Streamlit & Plotly  
- An AI-powered virtual assistant using GPT-4  
- Process optimisation simulations  

The system was tested with simulated industrial data and designed for real-time deployment in XRIT's production environment.
